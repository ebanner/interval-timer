## Original use case

I noticed myself rushing and that felt bad. I found I couldn't slow down on my own. So I used this app to have it so I only perform a single "action" until the next buzz. e.g. folding clothes, triaging tasks, navigating web pages

## Flow

1. Notice rushing
2. Notice feels bad
3. Use app to slow down
4. Urge to rush is gone
5. Notice feels good
